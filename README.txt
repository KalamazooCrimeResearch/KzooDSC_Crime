Hello!
This is a basic file structure for downloading and organizing data.
I have included download tools for the 3 cities in the makefile.
In order to download them, simply type "make" in the console while in the src directory
of this project.
To delete raw data (if you have cleaned it) simply type "make clean" in the same place.


In the future, I hope to provide more utilities! Thanks for having me onboard
-Miles
